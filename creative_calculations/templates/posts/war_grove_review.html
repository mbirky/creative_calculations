<h1>War Grove Review</h1>

<p>On February first of this year, 2019, I game I had been waiting for months to purchase called War Groove came out. It was marketed as a spiritual successor to one of my favorite video games Advanced Wars. After many hours playing it, I can say that they succeeded.</p>

<p>The feel of the game takes me back to my younger days when graphics weren't as good and games had to stand on their gameplay, not just how pretty they are. The mechanics of the game are simple, but the designers have done a great job of taking those mechanics and creating balanced maps that push the player to use units in new ways, like offering a sacrifice to gain an advantage.</p>

<p>Winning in most of the single-player campaign missions comes from either destroying the enemies base or by defeating their commander, this carries over into multiplayer nicely. Having two win conditions makes the gameplay choices complex as you also have a commander that, while powerful, if defeated causes you to lose the game. Each commander has an ability that if used correctly will dramatically change the tide of a battle.</p>

<p>One area that I would have liked to be better is the introduction of water armaments. Five water units are all introduced in the same mission, and the land units you have had in every mission up to this point do not exist. Water tactics were jarring as the movement for the new militants were confusing until I opened up the stats page and understood each movement type and how it was affected by different water terrain. Once I had a handle on what the new units did, I restarted the mission and did much better.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the one multiplayer game I have played so far I was not able to restart. A miss select on my part left my commander exposed, and I was quickly defeated. It was nice though as the game was against three friends who were all playing on PC and I was on the switch but didn't feel at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>This game has been a fun few hours of my time, and I am not even done with the campaign yet. With the bonus of more cross-platform play in the future, I am excited about the many more hours yet to come.</p>
