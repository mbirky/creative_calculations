Hello World
Hello, my name is Matthew Birky, and I am a software developer. I grew up in Alaska playing video games and getting outside whenever there was a sunny summer day. A few hikes in the rain did keep things lively though.
    In Highschool, I went to all my classes and did my best to pay attention, but loved every computer class I took. When it came time to apply for colleges, I realized that I could make my passions a reality by studying programming.
    Being 18, video games and how to make them seemed the best way to learn software development, so I moved from Alaska to Florida to study Video Game Development at Fullsail University. College was a crazy ride that I still sometimes wonder how I got through. From gaining firsthand experience of C++ floating point errors at 4 am with the assignment due in 5 hours to my team's final project, Frozen Flame, it was a great time.
    After college, I spent almost five years at Perforce Software Inc. where I worked as a Software Engineer in Test using C++, Python, PHP, and ruby. After finishing up at Perforce, I experimented with some Node.js before finally deciding to dig into Python.
    I have decided to take on the endeavor of this blog with the purpose of becoming a better steward of software development and its culture. I have long been an admirer of people who share their thoughts, paving the way for others to work software and I hope that my musing here may one day do the same for others.
Stay Creative,
Matthew Birky
